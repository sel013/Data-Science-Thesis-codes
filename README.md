# Data-Science-Thesis-codes
This repository contains all the code used for my thesis project on forecasting electricity consumption at the regional level in France. In this work, i compare three models (LSTM, GRU, and XGBoost) across four prediction horizons: 1-hour, 8-hour, 1-day, and 7-day ahead. The experiments are conducted on two datasets:
- A basic dataset without exogenous features
- An enriched dataset with exogenous features
